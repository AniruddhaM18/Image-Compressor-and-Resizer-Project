# Image-Compressor-and-Resizer-Project
Project Description:  
The web project is an online image compression and resizing tool that allows users to upload their images and optimise them for the web. The tool is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to quickly compress and resize their images.
Users can drag and drop their images directly onto the web page or select them from their local file system. Once the image is uploaded, the tool will automatically compress and resize it to reduce its file size while maintaining its visual quality.
The tool also provides advanced settings that allow users to customise the compression and resizing options to meet their specific needs. 
Overall, this web project is a powerful and user-friendly tool that simplifies the image optimization process for web developers, designers, and anyone else who needs to optimise their images for the web.
